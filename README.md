# Test_Task_WPF
Command and MVVM patterns implemented. Added navigation logic between pages, implemented using ContentControl, so that pages are not loaded all at once, but one at a time.  Added top crypto display page, top currency conversion page, user page (since no database was added, the user is created in the code, only once, also wallet class for user was not implemented, so some data on the display page is static), detailed information page about crypto (description of crypto and link to website were added there, which can be copied).  The project can be finished, but there are some problems at the moment.
